#### A demonstration "push target" for Fermentrack

[Fermentrack](http://www.fermentrack.com/) is a Python-based web application which assists with managing the fermentation of beer, wine, and other beverages. Fermentrack integrates with BrewPi-compatible temperature controllers as well as gravity sensors such as the Tilt Hydrometer and iSpindel. Fermentrack contains a feature which allows for data that has been collected from these devices to be "pushed out" for use by other applications.

This script is designed as a demonstration "target script" to which data can be pushed by Fermentrack. This script is intended for demonstration and testing purposes for web developers, and is not expected to be useful for end users.
